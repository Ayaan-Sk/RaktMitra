### **About RaktMitra**  
RaktMitra is an innovative platform designed to bridge the gap between blood donors and hospitals in times of emergency. Our mission is to create a seamless, efficient, and reliable network where those in urgent need of blood can connect with willing donors instantly. By leveraging technology, we aim to ensure that no life is lost due to the unavailability of blood.  

### **Problem Statement**  
Blood shortages remain a critical issue in India, with hospitals often struggling to find suitable donors in emergencies. Traditional methods of blood donation and request are slow, inefficient, and lack real-time data. Many patients face delays, and in severe cases, the lack of timely donation can lead to loss of life. RaktMitra addresses this issue by providing an easy-to-use platform where donors and hospitals can coordinate efficiently.  

### **Backend Development Progress**  
Our backend is currently being developed using PHP, enabling us to securely store and manage donor and hospital data. The system is being designed to handle real-time blood requests, donor availability updates, and seamless communication between stakeholders. As we progress, we will enhance the platform with advanced features to further streamline the donation process.
